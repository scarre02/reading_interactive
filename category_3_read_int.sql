(13, 'The Tale of Peter Rabbit', 'Once upon a time, there were four little rabbits named Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.<br>
They lived with their mother in a cozy burrow under the roots of a big fir tree.<br><br>

One morning, Mrs. Rabbit said, "You may go into the fields or down the lane, but don’t go into Mr. McGregor’s garden.<br>
Your father had an accident there, and I don’t want the same to happen to you."<br><br>

Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail were good little bunnies. They went to gather blackberries.<br>
But Peter, who was a bit more adventurous, ran straight to Mr. McGregor’s garden.<br><br>

Peter squeezed under the gate and found himself in a paradise of vegetables—lettuces, radishes, and carrots.<br>
He nibbled happily until he came to some parsley. But as he was munching, he heard a loud shout:<br>
"Stop, thief!" It was Mr. McGregor!<br><br>

Terrified, Peter ran as fast as his little legs could carry him. He dashed through the garden,<br>
knocking over flower pots and leaving a trail of footprints.<br><br>

Peter tried to find his way back to the gate but got lost. He hid in a watering can to catch his breath,<br>
but Mr. McGregor was close behind. Peter scrambled out and leaped into a gooseberry bush, tearing his jacket on the thorns.<br><br>

At last, Peter found a way out—a small hole in the garden fence. He wriggled through just in time<br>
and ran all the way home, leaving his blue jacket and shoes behind.<br><br>

When Peter reached the burrow, he was so tired that he flopped down on the soft sand floor.<br>
His mother shook her head when she saw him. "Peter, where is your jacket and shoes?" she asked.<br><br>

That evening, while Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail enjoyed bread and blackberries, Peter had to go to bed early<br>
with chamomile tea, which he didn’t like at all.<br><br>

Peter learned a lesson that day about listening to his mother and staying out of trouble—at least for a little while!<br><br>

The End.', 'story_13.webp', 3);
