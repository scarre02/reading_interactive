(7, 'Little Red Riding Hood', 
'Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by every one who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else. So she was always called Little Red Riding Hood.<br><br>

One day her mother said to her, "Come, Little Red Riding Hood, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing. And when you go into her room, don’t forget to say, good-morning, and don’t peep into every corner before you do it."<br><br>

"I will take great care," said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother, and gave her hand on it.<br><br>

The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood, a wolf met her. Little Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.<br><br>

"Good-day, Little Red Riding Hood," said he.<br><br>

"Thank you kindly, wolf."<br><br>

"Whither away so early, Little Red Riding Hood?"<br><br>

"To my grandmother''s."<br><br>

"What have you got in your apron?"<br><br>

"Cake and wine. Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger."<br><br>

"Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?"<br><br>

"A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood. Her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below. You surely must know it," replied Little Red Riding Hood.<br><br>

The wolf thought to himself, "What a tender young creature. What a nice plump mouthful, she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both." So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red Riding Hood, and then he said, "See, Little Red Riding Hood, how pretty the flowers are about here. Why do you not look round? I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing. You walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry."<br><br>

Little Red Riding Hood raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought, "Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay. That would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time." And so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.<br><br>

Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother''s house and knocked at the door.<br><br>

"Who is there?"<br><br>

"Little Red Riding Hood," replied the wolf. "She is bringing cake and wine. Open the door."<br><br>

"Lift the latch," called out the grandmother, "I am too weak, and cannot get up."<br><br>

The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother''s bed, and devoured her. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.<br><br>

Little Red Riding Hood, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.<br><br>

She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself, "Oh dear, how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much."<br><br>

She called out, "Good morning," but received no answer. So she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.<br><br>

"Oh, grandmother," she said, "what big ears you have."<br><br>

"The better to hear you with, my child," was the reply.<br><br>

"But, grandmother, what big eyes you have," she said.<br><br>

"The better to see you with, my dear."<br><br>

"But, grandmother, what large hands you have."<br><br>

"The better to hug you with."<br><br>

"Oh, but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have."<br><br>

"The better to eat you with."<br><br>

And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Little Red Riding Hood.<br><br>

When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself, "How the old woman is snoring. I must just see if she wants anything."<br><br>

So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. "Do I find you here, you old sinner," said he. "I have long sought you."<br><br>

Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf.<br><br>

When he had made two snips, he saw the Little Red Riding Hood shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying, "Ah, how frightened I have been. How dark it was inside the wolf."<br><br>

And after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe. Little Red Riding Hood, however, quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf''s belly, and when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.<br><br>

Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf''s skin and went home with it. The grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Little Red Riding Hood had brought, and revived, but Little Red Riding Hood thought to herself, "As long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so."<br><br>

(8, 'Sleeping Beauty', 
'Once upon a time, in a land of magic, there lived a beautiful princess named Aurora. She was known throughout the kingdom for her kindness, grace, and her heartwarming smile. Her hair was as golden as the sun, her eyes as blue as the sky, and her laughter as sweet as a songbird''s.<br><br>

Aurora''s story began in a grand palace, where she was born to a loving king and queen. Her arrival brought great joy to the kingdom, and the king and queen celebrated her birth with a big feast. As the kingdom rejoiced, three good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, gave their blessings to the little princess.<br><br>

Flora, with her red dress and magical wand, gave Aurora the gift of beauty. Fauna, in her green dress, gave her the gift of song. Merryweather, in her blue dress, wanted to give Aurora a gift too, but before she could finish, an evil sorceress named Maleficent appeared. Angry that she had not been invited to the celebration, she placed a curse on the young princess.<br><br>

Maleficent declared that on Aurora''s sixteenth birthday, she would prick her finger on a spinning wheel''s spindle and fall into a deep sleep from which she could only be awakened by true love''s kiss. The kingdom was filled with sadness, and the good fairies were determined to protect the princess from the curse.<br><br>

To keep Aurora safe, they took her to a hidden cottage in the woods, where she was given a new name, Briar Rose. There, she lived a simple life with the fairies as her guardians, and she was told nothing of her true identity or the curse that hung over her.<br><br>

Years passed, and Aurora grew into a lovely young girl. She had a deep love for the forest and all its creatures. She would sing and dance with the animals, and they, in turn, became her dearest friends.<br><br>

On the eve of her sixteenth birthday, the fairies decided it was time to tell Aurora the truth. They took her back to the palace, where her heartwarming smile and her beauty made everyone happy. But as the evening wore on, Aurora was drawn to an old spinning wheel she found in a dark, hidden room.<br><br>

Despite the fairies'' warnings, she pricked her finger on the spindle and fell into a deep, enchanted sleep, just as Maleficent had said. The king and queen, filled with sadness, placed Aurora on a bed of flowers and cried for their beloved daughter.<br><br>

The good fairies knew that Aurora could only be awakened by true love''s kiss, and they set out to find the prince who could break the curse. Prince Phillip, a brave and kind young man, was the one who had met Aurora in the forest and fallen in love with her as Briar Rose.<br><br>

With the fairies'' help, Prince Phillip battled through thorns, defeated Maleficent in her fearsome dragon form, and reached Aurora''s side. With a gentle kiss, he awakened the princess from her deep sleep, and her eyes sparkled with love as she looked at the prince.<br><br>

The kingdom rejoiced, and Aurora and Prince Phillip were married in a grand and joyous ceremony. The prince had proven that true love could conquer any curse, and the two of them ruled the kingdom with kindness and grace.<br><br>

And so, my dear child, that is the end of the story of Sleeping Beauty. It reminds us that love and courage can overcome even the darkest of curses. Now, close your eyes and let your dreams take you to a world of magic and enchantment. Goodnight, and may your dreams be as beautiful as Aurora''s heart.<br><br>

'Once upon a time, there was a poor boy named Jack who lived with his mother in a small cottage.<br><br>
They had no money, and their only possession was a cow. One day, Jack''s mother told him to sell the cow at the market so they could buy food.<br><br>
On the way, Jack met a mysterious old man who offered him five magic beans in exchange for the cow. Jack was curious and traded the cow for the beans. But when he got home, his mother was very angry.<br><br>
"Magic beans? These are useless!" she cried and threw them out the window.<br><br>
The next morning, Jack woke up and saw a giant beanstalk reaching into the sky! The beans really were magic! Excited, he decided to climb the beanstalk.<br><br>
At the top, Jack found a huge castle in the clouds. He knocked on the door, and a giant''s wife opened it.<br><br>
"Please, ma’am, I’m very hungry," Jack said.<br><br>
The kind woman gave him some food, but suddenly, he heard loud footsteps.<br><br>
"FEE-FI-FO-FUM! I smell the blood of an Englishman!"<br><br>
It was the giant! The wife quickly hid Jack in a cupboard. The giant sat down, counted his gold coins, and soon fell asleep.<br><br>
Jack saw his chance! He grabbed a bag of gold and ran back down the beanstalk.<br><br>
Jack and his mother were happy, but soon, the gold ran out. So Jack climbed the beanstalk again. This time, he saw the giant''s golden hen, which laid eggs made of gold! While the giant was asleep, Jack took the hen and escaped.<br><br>
Jack''s mother was thrilled, but Jack wanted to go one more time.<br><br>
For the third time, Jack climbed the beanstalk and saw the giant''s magical harp that could sing by itself! As Jack picked it up, the harp cried,<br><br>
"Master! Master! Someone is stealing me!"<br><br>
The giant woke up and chased Jack.<br><br>
Jack ran as fast as he could, sliding down the beanstalk. The giant followed him.<br><br>
"Mother! Bring me an axe!" Jack shouted.<br><br>
As soon as he reached the ground, Jack chopped down the beanstalk with all his strength.<br><br>
The giant fell from the sky—and that was the end of him!<br><br>
From then on, Jack and his mother lived happily ever after with the golden hen and the magic harp.<br><br>

"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?"<br><br>

The mirror always replied, "You, my Queen, are the fairest of them all." But one day, the mirror said, "Snow White is the fairest of them all!"<br><br>

The Evil Queen was furious! She ordered a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and get rid of her. But the kind huntsman felt sorry for Snow White and let her go.<br><br>

Snow White ran deep into the forest and found a small cottage. Inside, everything was tiny—tiny chairs, tiny beds, and tiny dishes. Tired and hungry, she ate a little food and fell asleep.<br><br>

When the seven dwarfs returned from working in the mines, they found her sleeping in their beds! Snow White woke up and was surprised to see them. The dwarfs introduced themselves: Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey.<br><br>

They listened to her story and said, “You can stay with us, but beware of the Evil Queen!”<br><br>

Back at the castle, the Evil Queen discovered that Snow White was still alive. She disguised herself as an old woman and went to the cottage with a poisoned apple.<br><br>

“Take a bite, dear child,” the old woman said. Snow White took a bite and fell into a deep sleep! When the dwarfs returned, they were heartbroken. They placed her in a glass coffin in the forest, hoping she would wake up one day.<br><br>

One day, a handsome prince rode through the forest and saw Snow White. He had heard stories of her kindness and beauty. He leaned down and kissed her gently.<br><br>

Suddenly, Snow White opened her eyes! The poison was broken! The dwarfs cheered with joy, and Snow White and the Prince rode away to the castle. They lived happily ever after.<br><br>

Kindness and goodness always win in the end.<br><br>
